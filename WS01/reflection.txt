Firstly, In regards to the external variables.The extern variable helped me to understand the difference between variables defined outside and inside 
the block of a function, and it helps in linking global variable into various files. Which actually made it more convenience. Furthermore, 
because external variables remain in existence permanently, rather than appearing and disappearing as functions are called and exited, they retain their values 
even after the functions that set them have returned. Secondly, in addition to the static variable and how confusing it was at first because I didn't have no
idea on how powerful static type variables was but with the explanation from the instructor, who made the concepts a lot easier to understand the use and how
Static variables can also be declared at local scope. Additionally, he the "profeesor" alo elaborate that, Static duration means that the object or variable is allocated when the 
program starts and is deallocated when the program ends. Lastly, I add a bit of struggle with the argument to main at first because it was a new concept to me,
So, I had to watch some few tutorials which made the concept a bit clear and the professor brief explanation on it as well. So, I was able to overcome and grasp the 
agrument to main concepts.
